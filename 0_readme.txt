v.01 cc teddavis.org 2016

instructions
------------------------
1 - open the audio_in.idml file and save it to the same folder before running
2 - open audio2basiljs application (has to stay in this folder!)
3 - open both '1_audio_in.jsx' + '2_stop.jsx' scripts
4 - run '1_audio_in.jsx'
5 - run '2_stop.jsx' when you are done! this really stops the script

keys (audio2basiljs app)
------------------------
UP / DOWN - adjusts audio input sensitivity
P - pause/unpause audio input

how/what?
------------------------
audio2basiljs listens to your audio input and saves the average audio value to a text file called 'audio.txt' inside of the /data folder located next to it. the basiljs script reads this document 15x a second and gives you the audio as a variable to play with.
